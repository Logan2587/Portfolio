            <p>Risk of Rain 2 is a roguelike shooter which takes place on an alien planet, Petrichor
                V. The main goal of the game is to escape the planet alive. To do so, the player
                must achieve one of the game's endings, usually through defeating a final boss. On
                their journey, the player will explore several unique stages, defeat strong monsters
                and bosses, and collect a vast amount of items to aid them in the game.</p>

            <h1>Main Game Review</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Risk of Rain 2 is a roguelike third person shooter. The player finds themselves as a
                survivor amongst an alien planet, Petrichor V. Following a distress call, a ship is
                sent to investigate. This second ship sends the player to the planet's surface and
                marks the beginning of the game. To survive, the player battles endless hordes of
                monsters and explores incredible environments along the way. To help them, the
                player has access to items which grant them powerful boosts, working off of their
                own set of usable abilities.</p>

        <section class="gametext2">
            <h2>Environment</h2>
            <p>Risk of Rain 2 contains a good quantity of unique, explorable environments. Each
                stage is vastly different from one another, usually both in layout and appearance.
                The functionality of each stage depends on how far the player must progress to reach
                it. Earlier stages are small, while later stages are large. This size difference is
                to compensate for the player increasing in speed as they collect items which enhance
                their movement. Later stages also commonly have a higher level of vertical
                complexity for this reason as well. The music track for each stage is usually
                different, with an exception lying in the same song being used for Gilded Coast and
                Rallypoint Delta. Tne music was created with a few parameters in mind to aid the
                gameplay. The composer, Chris Christodolou has mentioned in his developer
                commentaries that the songs needed to be long to accomodate for the player spending
                a potentially large amount of time on each stage. He explained that the first game
                needed only to convey the impression that the environments were large, since it was
                a two dimensional game. Risk of Rain 2, however, is three dimensional. Chris
                acknowledged this, and made music to accompany environments that actually were this
                large in size. It's easy to get lost in exploring each stage at first! To progress
                between stages, the player must complete the teleporter event. (Explained in later
                section)</p>

            <h2>Characters</h2>
            <p>The characters in Risk of Rain 2 are called survivors, and fucntion as choosable
                options to control the game's playstyle. Each survivor looks and plays very
                differently. Some survivors attack from a long range, while others prefer to get in
                close. Some control the area around them with abilities that take hold on the
                environment around them, while others are durable enough to survive nearly anything
                thrown at them. They can be astronauts from the ship sent to Petrichor V, or a
                lizard that spits toxic venom out of its mouth. Point is, there is a lot of
                variation in the options provided. As far as NPC's, theres only really one option
                that comes to mind. Newt is the lunar shopkeeper, who oversees the Bazaar Between
                Time. Newt doesn't really do much themselves, and has no notable interactions other
                than booting the player out if they decide to hurt Newt.</p>

            <h2>Monsters</h2>
            <p>Monsters are the main threat to the player throughout the game. Monsters will
                continuously spawn in waves on nearly all stages until the teleporter event is
                completed. There are plenty of monster types which the game can spawn, usually
                decided by how long the player has been playing for and what stage they are on.
                Monsters can also spawn as elites. Elite monsters take on a particular color tied to
                their elite type, and gain a specific buff as well. Blazing elites set the player on
                fire, and leave a trail of flames where they move. Glacial elites slow the player,
                and explode into ice on death. Overloading elites attatch an explosive electric orb
                where they attack, dealing additional damage to the player. Mending elites heal
                nearby monsters, and drop a healing explosion on death. Gilded elites periodically
                surround themselves in a barrier, stealing the player's money if hit. Malachite
                elites disable the player's ability to heal for a time, and periodically shoot out
                spikes which do the same. Celestine elites create a large field around themselves,
                making all monsters inside of it become invisible. Twisted elites create a field
                around themselves, which retaliates damage to the player if a monster inside of it
                is damaged. Perfected elites will cripple the player on hit, and shoot homing
                fireballs periodically. Monsters can also be bosses. Bosses are much stronger
                monsters, usually very large in size. While boss monsters can spawn naturally, they
                are most often seen as the primary target of a teleporter event. Bosses can also be
                any of the aforementioned elite types!</p>

            <h2>Interactables &amp; Items</h2>
            <h3>Items</h3>
            <p>"Items" form the foundation of how the game is played. Items are collectibles that
                the player can receive through several means, most common of which being through
                opening a chest for money that the player collects through killing monsters. Items
                generally provide passive effect bonuses that make the player stronger in some
                aspect. Some items allow the player to deal more damage, while others offer a source
                of healing. Items can be of several different qualities: Common, Uncommon,
                Legendary, Boss Items, Lunar, Equipment, or Void items. Rarer items typically
                provide a greater effect, but are harder to come by.</p>
            <h3>Interactables</h3>
            <p>Interactables serve several different purposes in Risk of Rain 2. To elaborate from
                earlier, the teleporter is an interactable found on most stages which serves as the
                main way to advance the game. On activation, the teleporter spawns a boss which must
                be defeated. In addition, the teleporter must be charged to 99% as well. This
                sequence is refered to as the "teleporter event". Chests function as another
                important interactable. As a list of other interactables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Drones - Repairable allies which cost money to activate.</li>
                <li>Shrines - Causes special effects determined by the type of shrine.</li>
                <li>Multishops - Offers a choice between several items, rather than pure chance like
                    with chests.</li>
                <li>Barrels - Can be opened for money.</li>
                <li>ETC of similar purposes.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Personal Conclusion</h2>
            <p>Risk of Rain 2 is a fantastic game I can heavily recommend to anybody with a taste
                for roguelikes. It's a genre defining entry that shakes the idea of whats possible
                in an indie title. I've accumulated hundreds of hours in playtime, and will very
                likely continue to grow that number over time. The game series was originally
                created by two college students, and saw such success that it has grown into what it
                is today. Gearbox, the publishing studio, has purchased the IP from Hopoo games.
                While the future of what's to come of the Risk of Rain franchise is uncertain, I
                would like to remain hopeful that future entries of this game are possible. As
                another note, the music for this game is incredible! Cannot stress enough how
                amazing Chris Christodolou's work is in this game. Look him up on youtube sometime!
                I've even tried to by the records! (My bank stopped me because I cannot make
                purchases in euros.)</p>
