            <p>For this project, I decided to look into the State of the Union Addresses of the
                presidents near John F. Kennedy's term in office. The texts were split into two
                groups: One including JFK's addresses and the three presidents prior to JFK's death,
                and the other including the three presidents following JFK's death.</p>

            <p>To begin my research into the topic, I decided to look for differences between how
                the two corpuses handled the idea of war as compared to the world. I found that the
                presidencies before JFK's death (including his term itself) included much more
                mentions of war in the context of the world. The presidencies following JFK's death
                however, mention war less often when talking about the world. Could this be the
                result of a unification of the people? Maybe the assasination of JFK was a turning
                point in how violence was seen by the people?</p>

        <div class="txtabody">
            <p>I found it interesting that JFK rarely mentioned the soviets at all. It seemed to be
                an issue of importance to other presidents near his term, but JFK avoids mentioning
                the soviet union itself in his State of the Union Addresses. Could this be a reason
                for his assasination? Maybe he was killed for his lack of attention to global
                conflict on the soviet front? During this time, the United States and the Soviet
                Union was engaged in the Cold War. While this was happening, the soviets were also
                invading the middle east. This was an issue of great importance on the global
                stage.</p>

            <p>This screenshot makes it clear that the subject of war is much more prevalent with
                the presidencies prior to JFK's death. It also shows how reluctant JFK was to talk
                about war in his addresses himself. His death did seem to have an impact on how the
                globe wanted to proceed with the Cold War, as evidenced by the diminished presence
                of the word in the addresses following JFK's death.</p>

            <p>Also of note, the popular 3grams compared between the collection of texts. A lot of
                similar phrases appear between the two corpuses, making it noted that the rhetorical
                phrases were not altered across this portion of time. Strangely on the left, money
                is a focus for president Truman only. On the right, the Soviet Union makes its
                appearance in 3grams, showing that the phrase is more densely spoken of following
                JFK, going against the idea of war being less of a pressing issue. Maybe this was in
                an attempt to lower tension between the US and the Soviet Union?</p>
