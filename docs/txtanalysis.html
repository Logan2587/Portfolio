            <p>For this project, I decided to look into the <strong>State of the Union
                    Addresses</strong> of the presidents near John F. Kennedy's term in office. The
                texts were split into <strong>two groups</strong>: One including JFK's addresses and
                the three presidents prior to JFK's death, and the other including the three
                presidents following JFK's death.</p>

            <p>To begin my research into the topic, I decided to look for differences between how
                the two corpuses handled the idea of war as compared to the world. I found that the
                presidencies before JFK's death (including his term itself) included much more
                mentions of war in the context of the world. The presidencies following JFK's death
                however, mention war less often when talking about the world. Could this be the
                result of a unification of the people? Maybe the assasination of JFK was a turning
                point in how violence was seen by the people? During his presidential term, JFK
                aimed to be more transparent with how politicians address the public. One of JFK's
                main focuses in his term was his drive to put a man on the moon. The cold war didn't
                officially end (if you can say it did at all) until 1991, but the mention of war
                signidicantly diminished in the following union addresses. Through the idea of the
                space race, it's possible that tensions between the United States and the Soviet
                Union were alleviated in non-violent means.</p>

        <div class="txtabody">
            <p>I found it interesting that JFK rarely mentioned the soviets at all. It seemed to be
                an issue of importance to other presidents near his term, but JFK avoids mentioning
                the soviet union itself in his State of the Union Addresses. Could this be a reason
                for his assasination? Maybe he was killed for his lack of attention to global
                conflict on the soviet front? During this time, the United States and the Soviet
                Union was engaged in the Cold War. While this was happening, the soviets were also
                invading the middle east. This was an issue of great importance on the global stage.
                I am of the opinion that the true highest level of authority in the United States
                lies with the CIA. It's possible that the CIA deemed the issue of the Cold War as
                too important to ignore. The lack of mention on the topic could have contributed to
                a lack of expected military sign-ups, which the CIA might have seen as harmful to
                the nation. It is also possible that his reluctancy to mention Soviets may have
                served as a de-escalation method! I have particular opinions on how the media
                portrays violent information, as I believe violence to produce more violence. Maybe
                JFK understood this, and wanted to prevent such an infohazard from reaching the
                American population?</p>

            <p>This screenshot makes it clear that the subject of war is much more prevalent with
                the presidencies prior to JFK's death. It also shows how reluctant JFK was to talk
                about war in his addresses himself. His death did seem to have an impact on how the
                globe wanted to proceed with the Cold War, as evidenced by the diminished presence
                of the word in the addresses following JFK's death. According to public information,
                Lee Harvey Oswald (JFK's assassinator) was a communist. If this is truly the case,
                it might be a consideration that JFK's assasination was a point of climax in the
                Cold War. The fear of futher violence may have caused a push towards a less violent
                media. It's likely that this trend continued for several presidential terms
                following JFK, and reflected in the State of the Union Addresses.</p>

        <div class="txtabody">
            <p>Also of note, the popular 3grams compared between the collection of texts. A lot of
                similar phrases appear between the two corpuses, making it noted that the rhetorical
                phrases were not altered across this portion of time. Strangely on the left, money
                is a focus for president Truman only. On the right, the Soviet Union makes its
                appearance in 3grams, showing that the phrase is more densely spoken of following
                JFK, going against the idea of war being less of a pressing issue. Following the
                assasination, the soviets may have been a forced topic of interest. While tht
                soviets themselves may be of higher concentration in the document, the mention of
                war was not.</p>
