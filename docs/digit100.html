            <h1>Website Development Comparison Essay</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Through the completion of two separate sites, I have learned a lot about website
                development. By comparing the two, I can point out significant differences in how I
                approached making them. Here, I will elaborate on several aspects of the creation of
                each site.</p>
            <h2>Github</h2>
            <p>The most significant challenges a new learner can face in the development of a Github
                website almost all revolve around learning your way around the coding syntax. Not
                only are the elements themselves a learning curve, but styling them comes with
                significant challenges as well. While this may seem detrimental to you, it actually
                can force you to understand the inner workings of your website and allow you to
                personalize it with much more precision. Github surpasses its counterpart in this
                field. As I know more about my site, I can personalize it without restriction. The
                challenge of changing the layout is figuring out how to write the code to do so.
                Experimenting with containers and attributes proves to be a confusing task, for
                sure. To develop in Github, it is necessary to learn the syntax of your site, and
                have a general creative idea to forge your site into. To develop my Github site
                further, I would like to learn more about CSS styling, as it seems to be the most
                crucial part in the development of the site.</p>
            <h2>Word Press</h2>
            <p>The challenges of Word Press differ from those of Github, in that it becomes an issue
                of user interface, rather than the coding itself. A website author in Word Press
                must fight with the user interface, and preset themes to create a site which suits
                them. The advantage of this, is that the creation of the site is much faster. This
                speed sacrifices personalization, however. There is much less user control over the
                content of the site when the user does not have easy direct access to the code
                themselves. The challenges in modifying the layout are in a similar fashion.
                Constantly chaning settings and seeint what changes are made to the site. The skills
                requires to create a site in this manner are significantly less expecting. You
                simply need have a good eye for what theme you wish to paint your site with. I would
                generally not like to learn much more of Word Press, as I see it as a much less
                enjoyable medium to create a site with.</p>
